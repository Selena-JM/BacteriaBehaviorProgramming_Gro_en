What I understand of Gro language from reading the original paper's code 

To define something use :=

To test equality use =

Finish all lines decalarations by ; (not every line but only when finished a declaration, a function or anything)


You can use gro functions 
    signal
    reaction
    etc


Functions are not the same as programs 
    Functions : declare with "fun" then the name and then the arguments an then a dot 
    EX : "fun puissance a n ." will declare the function "puissance" with the arguments a and n.
    Need an 'end;' at the end of the function

    Programs : is a set of initializers and guarded commands within a set of curly brackets. 
    --> like classes in Java ? 
    For example, here is a program that has one initializer for the variable t, and two guarded commands: 
    one that updates t, and another that resets it if it gets too big.
	
        program p(x) := {

            t := 0;

            true :   { t := t + dt }
            t >= x : { t := 0      }

        };


Example from ChatGPT to set up environment

# Import necessary libraries
import gro

# Define function to set up the growth medium
def setup_growth_medium():
    # Define nutrients and their concentrations
    glucose = gro.Molecule('Glucose')
    glucose_concentration = 10  # in mM
    ammonium = gro.Molecule('Ammonium')
    ammonium_concentration = 5  # in mM
    
    # Add nutrients to the growth medium
    gro.add_nutrient(glucose, glucose_concentration)
    gro.add_nutrient(ammonium, ammonium_concentration)
    
    # Set initial pH of the environment
    gro.set_ph(7.0)

# Define function to set initial conditions
def setup_initial_conditions():
    # Set initial population of bacteria
    initial_population = 1e6  # in cells/mL
    
    # Set initial temperature
    initial_temperature = 37  # in Celsius
    
    # Set initial conditions
    gro.set_initial_bacteria_count(initial_population)
    gro.set_temperature(initial_temperature)

# Call functions to set up growth medium and initial conditions
setup_growth_medium()
setup_initial_conditions()

# Run the simulation
gro.run_simulation()
